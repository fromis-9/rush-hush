- Text Wrapping for Long Titles
- Featured Artists from YouTube Titles

ERROR: File '/Users/name/Documents/videofm-beta/videofm-app/aoablack_top1_2024_12.mp4' already exists. Overwrite? [y/N]

this should also be able to be done thru the app. remember when I said "Please use ur initiative to fix the other ones too (if they are any)."

MY CLAUDE SONNET NEXT PROMPT ^^^

- progress bar goas to half full when "extracting video clips". thats not even accurate. i feel like the progress bar could use work. progress bar should be a master global bar that shows progess for entire compilation



/////

Progress bar is still inaccurate. 


scrolling in the terminal log also difficult when the program is running. it keeps teleporting to the most recent update

preview button still doesnt work when the final video exists. i was getting "Cannot preview video: Video not yet created"

file overwrite log not showing up

- fix when log opens due to unnecessary ERROR logs

- mention public last fm scrobble history in README

- instead of y/n maybe just do filename(1) instead or filename_1 or smth
